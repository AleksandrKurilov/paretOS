  "<h3>Welcome to the Pareto Experience!</h3><p></p><p>You are reading the Notepad - a place for you to make quick notes, reminders, to-do's, general brainstorming. It automatically saves when your mouse's focus shifts elsewhere! On your dashboard, you can see your Learning modules - one for learning the tools of a full-stack developer, all the way through earning your first freelance gig &amp; writing your technical resume.</p><br /><p>Here you can find the Pareto Arena, a multi-player productivity tracker where you earn points for modeling the behavior of top performers. Waking up early, putting in the work on a daily basis to get closer to your goals, meditation, limiting dopamine-wrecking behaviors such as smoking &amp; excessive drinking. You are able to track your performance over time, and compete in weekly Sprints with your friends, classmates &amp; colleagues. </p><p></p><p>Included is the Library of Context, a comprehensive set of curated resources for you to learn not just the skills required to build in full-stack JavaScript, but also economic resources such as job boards you may not have heard about, and a home for specific resources on a city by city basis. Included is the ability for community members to submit their own suggested resources, developing what will be a communal source of information to lower barriers to entry.</p><br /><p>You will see red icons with a question mark on them scattered through the platform - these are interactive 'tours', where you can learn more about how to successfully use the tools at your disposal. </p><p></p><p>Have fun, compete &amp; enjoy your life! </p>";
